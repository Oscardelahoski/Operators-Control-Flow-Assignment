Answer:

a. Arithmetic Operators

i, let a = 2 + 3;
ii, let b = 5 * 2;

b. Assignment Operators

i. let a = 5;

ii. let b = 2;
 b += 3;

c. Comparison Operators

let a = 5;
let b = 3;

i. console.log (a == b);
ii. console.log (a > b);

d. Logical Operators

Let age = 18;
let nationality = 'Nigeria';

i. (age >= 18  && nationality === 'Nigeria') ? console.log ('eligible to vote') : console.log ('not eligible to vote');

Femi's best food is bread and beans. But he can still eat his food if either one is available

e. Bitwise Operators

i. let a = 3 & 1;
ii. let a = 4 | 2;

*****************************************
4. What is the result when the following program is executed

for (let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7) {
